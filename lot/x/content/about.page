### Usage

Skin files are stored in the `.\lot\content` folder. You can add new skin files there and activate it by updating the `name` value of `.\state.php` file:

~~~ .txt
.\
└── lot\
    └── content\
        └── log\
~~~

The default skin name is `log` and so we have `log` as the value for the `name` property:

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'title' => 'Site Title',
    'description' => 'Site description.',
    'language' => 'en',
    'name' => 'log' // ← this
];
~~~

### Features

 - Detect asset path relative to the `.\lot\asset` and `.\lot\content\:skin\asset` folder [^1]
 - Detect skin path relative to the `.\lot\content\:skin` folder [^1]
 - Add HTML classes automatically to the `<html>` element based on the current page conditional statements.

These HTML classes will be added to the `<html>` element that has a `class` attribute:

 - `error:404` → Will be added if there is no page or pages to load.
 - `has:next` → Will be added if it is possible to go to the next page.
