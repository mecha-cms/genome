This extension works by looking for two special places in the HTML document, i.e. right before the `</head>` and `</body>` tag, and process all assets that you were added to the hook storage and then spit them out into that places:

~~~ .html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Lorem Ipsum</title>
  •</head>
  <body>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
  •</body>
</html>
~~~

The first place is generally used to insert CSS assets, and the second place is used to insert JavaScript assets.

### Usage

To append CSS assets to the `<head>` section, write this code in an `index.php` file:

~~~ .php
Asset::set('path/to/file.css');
~~~

To append JavaScript assets to the `<body>` section, write this code in an `index.php` file:

~~~ .php
Asset::set('path/to/file.js');
~~~

Once added, this extension will process the file path and then will output them into the HTML page as `<link>` tags for CSS files and `<script>` tags for JavaScript files.

> **Note:** This extension will ignore files that does not exist.
